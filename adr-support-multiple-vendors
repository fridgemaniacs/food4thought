# ADR 4. Support multiple vendors by reusing Ghost Kitchen client

## STATUS
Accepted

## CONTEXT
Currently we support only one kitchen / vendor - our "Ghost kitchen".

In future we want to support more vendors.

Vendors will need same functionality like our "Ghost kitchen".

We can create separate client instance for them or we can reuse our internal solution and just extend it to support more vendors. 

## DECISION
We will reuse our internal solution that we use for our "Ghost kitchen".

"Ghost kitchen" would become just one of those vendors.

It only makes sense since same functionality is needed for all vendors.
And we do not have to support 2 different solutions for the same problem.

## CONSEQUENCES
It might be harder to support differentiation between our "Ghost kitchen" and other vendors.

In future vendors might want their own instances of the solution.
Or we might want to manage vendors and keep "Ghost kitchen" as primary vendor.

We decided this is not an issue right now and it allows us to safe time and resources by implementing only one version of application.
